## Overview

This project aims to analyze learner engagement data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns in course participation, learner behavior, and satisfaction levels. The goal is to identify key factors that influence course ratings, completion rates, and overall engagement. By examining demographics, feedback, and engagement metrics, the analysis provides actionable insights to improve course offerings, enhance learner experience, and drive personalized learning strategies.

## Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns.

- Understand the factors affecting ratings.

- Analyze engagement time distribution and its impact on learner behavior.

- dentify highly engaging and underperforming courses.

- Visualize key insights using graphs and charts.


# Key Insights
1. Courses like **DM101** and **UX303** show highest student engagement.
2. Students aged **25-30** are most engaged; engagement drops in higher age brackets.
3. Locations such as **Bangalore** and **Mumbai** show higher average engagement time.
4. Courses with higher **completion rates** often correlate with higher **feedback ratings**.
5. Top student segments demonstrate high satisfaction **and** engagement â€” key for ambassador programs.


#  Recommendations
1. **Promote popular courses** with high engagement through targeted campaigns.
2. **Personalize content** for age groups with lower engagement, especially 31+, Due to Their Academic Learning Rate is Low.
3. **Leverage feedback analytics** to enhance lower-rated courses using keyword-based sentiment analysis.
